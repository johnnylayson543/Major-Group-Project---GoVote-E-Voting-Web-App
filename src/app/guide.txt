Register Election - User is already registered for GoVote account but is given a choice to choose and register for an election (ballot). THIS IS NOT A REGISTER ACCOUNT
Create Account - To create an account, admin must put the ppsn (add_person_range) to the person collection (could use a form for interaction). If the user registers but ppsn doesn't exist in person, it will fail. But if it does, it will create a new one.
